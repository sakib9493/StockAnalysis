The Delta variant seems to be sinking its teeth into the economy, taking a massive bite into the jobs picture. 
Job gains of 235,000 in August reported today by the U.S. government were more than 500,000 below the average analyst estimate for 750,000, and raise new questions about the pace of economic growth as the country continues to struggle with Covid. Lack of any gains for the Leisure and Hospitality sector played a big role in the disappointing data. 
On the plus side, the Labor Department did raise its estimates for jobs growth in June and July, to 962,000 and 1.1 million, respectively. You can’t necessarily discount the possibility that we could see an upward revision for August next month but, given the impact Leisure & Hospitality had on today’s report (see more below), subsequent reports could hinge on the Delta variant. 
Major indices held pretty steadily after the report—arguably quite a feat given the recent string of record highs. Perhaps it’s one of those times when bad news doesn’t have much of an impact on stock prices, as a report like this could ease fears of any near-term Fed move to pull back on stimulus. Remember, just a week ago Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the Fed could begin tapering its bond-buying program but added that employment hadn’t met the central bank’s goals. This report doesn’t really go very far to meet the Fed’s goal of getting employment back to where it was before Covid.
A Peek Under The Hood Of Today’s Report
Having said all that, remember, this is just one month of data. One month or one report is never a trend. Jobs growth is averaging a healthy 766,000 a month since June, even with today’s disappointing number factored in.
Also, a lot of this miss appeared to be centered in the Leisure and Hospitality space, where employment was unchanged after averaging gains of 350,000 per month over the previous six months. That’s probably the biggest reason for the huge miss in expectations by Wall Street, and likely reflects Delta variant concerns affecting restaurants and hotels. Assuming the country gets a handle on this variant in the coming months, it’s possible jobs growth in this category could rebound pretty quickly, as it often has following disturbances.
It was good to see 37,000 jobs added in manufacturing and 53,000 jobs added in transportation and warehousing during August. Those are categories you like to see going up because they can speak to decent underlying growth in economic demand by businesses and consumers. Also, average hourly earnings rose 0.6%, which was above the 0.3% estimate and might have partly reflected a lack of growth in the low-paying Leisure and Hospitality sector. This isn’t a number that’s likely to have the Fed worried about wage inflation, but it does mean more money going into peoples’ pockets—never a bad thing. 
Also, you can’t overlook that the overall unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% the previous month. That’s the lowest since Covid began. Sometimes, drops in the unemployment rate can reflect discouraged workers leaving the labor force and no longer being counted as unemployed, but that wasn’t the case in August. Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, or, as the Labor Department defines it, “the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force,” decreased by 295,000 over the month.
Before the jobs report today, the market seemed tied up in a dull, pre-holiday type of trading over the last few sessions.

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

The company cited a robust slate of content including the hit Korean television show “Squid Game,” which helped bring in new subscribers. Netflix rallied 1.5% on the news.
Robotic surgery company Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG) also squeezed in an earnings announcement just before the close. The company beat earnings and revenue leading to a 1.1% rally after the report.  
Wednesday’s premarket began with Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) beating earnings estimates but missing on revenue. The company also increased its forward guidance. However, the stock was little changed in premarket trading.
On the positive side, medical device company Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) traded 2.7% higher in premarket trading after reporting big profits on higher sales. To top off the positive earnings announcement, the company increased its full-year earnings outlook. Also, in health care, biotech stock Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) reported strong earnings thanks to its new Alzheimer’s drug. Biogen is also partnering with Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SAGE) on an experimental depression drug they plan to submit to the FDA in the second half of 2022.
Not all health care stocks are having a positive morning, Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) fell 22% in premarket trading on a news story from Politico that the company is struggling to manufacture its vaccine in a way that meets regulators’ quality standards. The issues are expected to delay the company and keep it from hitting key delivery targets.
Another negative theme is companies are having trouble controlling costs. Chili’s parent company Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE: EAT), WD-40 Company (NASDAQ: WDFC), and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) all reported earnings and cited struggles with higher costs, particularly labor costs, over the quarter. The reports appear to conflict with the Fed’s transitory inflation projection.
Oil service provider Baker Hughes (NYSE: BKR) missed on the top and bottom-line estimates despite competitor Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) meeting analysts’ expectations and projecting a “multi-year upcycle”.
