Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Last week's bullish calls included oil refiners, semiconductor makers and Leon Cooperman picks.
The electric vehicle leader, a meme stock and big banks were among the bearish calls seen.

September tends to make Wall Street nervous, and the markets have ended the first full (though holiday-shortened) week of the month in the red. That was led by a 2% or so drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, but the declines in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were not far behind.
With the indexes still pretty close to all-time highs, equity valuations appear stretched, and the broad market has not seen a 5% correction since October of last year. Add to that worries about the Delta variant, inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and political rancor, and there is plenty for investors to be nervous about.
Note that Goldman Sachs did downgrade its economic outlook for the United States last week, citing fears of lower consumer spending, and Morgan Stanley sees up to a 15% pullback in stocks by the end of the year. In fact, Bank of America projects negative returns for the S&P 500 for the next decade.

The rallies add to a week where inflation may play a big part.

Investors must digest the information from a busy economic calendar along with the unofficial start of earnings season this Wednesday when JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL), and others announce their third-quarter results. Additionally, Monday starts with a closed bond market in recognition of the Columbus Day holiday. This could result in lower volumes for stock trading. Lower volumes can increase the risk in trading which is why many traders may choose to reduce the size of their trades on Monday.
Over the Weekend
Investors already have a lot to digest with a couple of interesting developments over the weekend. First, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) cut its forecast on U.S. economic growth. On Sunday, Reuters reported that declining fiscal support and the trouble getting semiconductors are leading to the slowdown. Additionally, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) had to cancel numerous flights. The company cited weather and personnel scheduling problems.
On the positive side, Morgan Stanley analysts started coverage of SoFi (SOFI) with an overweight rating. SoFi is fintech service company that offers home and personal loans along with credit cards. The company was up more than 4% higher in premarket trading.
Last Friday, investors got a chance to review the disappointing September jobs report, but bond traders didn’t seem to care. The 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) rose 2.16% on Friday, which could suggest that the report wasn’t bad enough to keep the Fed from tapering its bond-buying program. 
While the headline “194,000 jobs created” was less than half of what was expected, the report came with upward revisions to the August jobs report, which means the quarter may have been better than initially thought. Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, which was also better than expected, although much of that was people leaving the workforce which means they’re no longer counted in the report as part of the workforce. Nonetheless, there are enough positives that bond investors appear to be preparing for the Fed to stop buying so many bonds.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

At one point in 2021, Musk was worth as much as all the MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL teams combined.
Here’s a look at how quickly Musk could become a trillionaire and if he is on pace to be the first to hit this new status.
Who Could Be First Trillionaire?: John D. Rockefeller became the first billionaire in the world in 1916. Rockefeller was the founder of Standard Oil, an oil giant that was later split due to antitrust concerns.
Standard Oil is now represented by Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), BP plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), which all own pieces of Rockefeller's former company. 
It took another 83 years before someone passed the $100 billion wealth mark: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
There are now nine centibillionaires with several of them having a shot at hitting the trillion-dollar wealth level.

China Petroleum & Chemical Corp ADR (NYSE: SNP)
China Petroleum & Chemical, also known as Sinopec, is China's largest domestic oil refiner and chemical producer.
Investing in Chinese stocks is not for the faint of heart in 2022 thanks to crackdowns on public companies by both Chinese and U.S. regulators.

Sinopec shares also have a 9% dividend yield, the highest of any stock on this list.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $66.30 price target for SNP stock.
