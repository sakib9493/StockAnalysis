Last week's bullish calls included the iPhone maker, a top oilfield services stock and a pharmaceutical giant.
FAANG stocks, the top cryptocurrency and meme stocks were among the bearish calls seen.

After a shaky start, the markets bounced back this past week from the prior week's dip into the red. The Nasdaq led the big U.S. indexes with an almost 3% gain for the week, while the S&P 500 was up about 2% and Dow Jones industrial average about 1% higher.
COVID-19 has been creeping back into the headlines, partly due to the Tokyo Olympics. That has prompted fears that the economic recovery might stumble. Both crude prices and Bitcoin slumped during the week, while chip shortages and inflation remained. The brewing debt ceiling fight in Congress is only just getting started.
However, the earnings-reporting season ramped up this week as well, and strong results from Dow Jones industrials helped buoy the markets. While the first FAANG component to post results disappointed, other strong tech sector reports have increased the high expectations for the coming week's results from the iPhone maker and market darling.

In a blunt and unpleasant reminder of how crises thousands of miles away can puncture the heart of the U.S. markets, a real estate crisis in Hong Kong took much of the blame for the sharpest daily losses in more than two months for the major U.S. indices. The so-called “horsemen of risk” like bonds, volatility, the U.S. dollar, and “defensive” stock sectors climbed back into the saddle after months of lazing around the corral.
While analysts mainly cited the issues around Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail, that wasn’t the only issue sending a shudder around the world today. Though it should be noted that a default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders not just in Asia but throughout the globe. Reuters reported that Evergrande bonds were trading for 29 cents on the dollar on Monday.

This includes technology, gambling, and video games. Remember, markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday, so we could see increased action and volatility overnight when the market opens tonight.
Worries about the default and its possible side effects could help explain why Financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) were among those taking the most heat Monday. Also, Energy got clobbered as crude sank amid global growth fears. Crude oil futures (/CL) tested the $70 level before moving a little higher on a down day. And the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) traded above 28 but fell to just below ...",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/23022505,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/new-york-2408785_1920_20.jpg,"['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Futures', 'Commodities', 'Global', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']"

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

The company cited a robust slate of content including the hit Korean television show “Squid Game,” which helped bring in new subscribers. Netflix rallied 1.5% on the news.
Robotic surgery company Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ: ISRG) also squeezed in an earnings announcement just before the close. The company beat earnings and revenue leading to a 1.1% rally after the report.  
Wednesday’s premarket began with Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) beating earnings estimates but missing on revenue. The company also increased its forward guidance. However, the stock was little changed in premarket trading.
On the positive side, medical device company Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) traded 2.7% higher in premarket trading after reporting big profits on higher sales. To top off the positive earnings announcement, the company increased its full-year earnings outlook. Also, in health care, biotech stock Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) reported strong earnings thanks to its new Alzheimer’s drug. Biogen is also partnering with Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SAGE) on an experimental depression drug they plan to submit to the FDA in the second half of 2022.
Not all health care stocks are having a positive morning, Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVAX) fell 22% in premarket trading on a news story from Politico that the company is struggling to manufacture its vaccine in a way that meets regulators’ quality standards. The issues are expected to delay the company and keep it from hitting key delivery targets.
Another negative theme is companies are having trouble controlling costs. Chili’s parent company Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE: EAT), WD-40 Company (NASDAQ: WDFC), and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) all reported earnings and cited struggles with higher costs, particularly labor costs, over the quarter.

President Biden deserves credit for having so far avoided World War III. He has resisted calls to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would lead to war with Russia, and he has clearly signaled he has no intention of fighting Russia. 

But Biden has, in effect, helped launch an economic World War III, imposing unprecedented sanctions on a large and economically important country. Russia isn't an Iran or Libya. It's a continent-spanning country with a population of 145 million, and it is (or was) one of the world's top five exporters of oil, natural gas, nickel, wheat, coal, and other commodities. Let's breakdown why these sanctions are dangerous for us, and close with our investment approach to them. 
What's The Endgame?
One of the biggest problems with the sanctions is that there's been no endgame articulated for them, and without an endgame, they may never end. The United States has had sanctions on Cuba since 1962. Obviously, the most recent, and most severe sanctions the West imposed on Russia were in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but will the new sanctions be lifted if Russia withdraws its invasion force, or signs a peace treaty with the government of the Ukraine? Or will we demand Russia abandon Crimea (circled below), which is majority Russian ethnically, historically Russian, and includes Sevastopol, the home port of Russia's Black Sea Fleet?

The Impact Of War And Sanctions
In a post earlier this month (Sanctioning Ourselves), I mentioned how our system's top names reflected the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent U.S.-led sanctions on Russia:
As regular readers know, our system doesn't consider the macro picture when selecting its top names. Instead, it gauges stock and options market sentiment to estimate which securities are likely to perform the best over the next six months. Nevertheless, that bottoms-up approach is painting a clear macro picture when you look at our most recent top ten.
