Unfortunately, a dividend yield is only as good as the company paying it, and an extremely high dividend yield can often be a red flag that a stock has underperformed significantly.
Here are six S&P 500 dividend stocks with at least 4% yields that investors can buy and sleep easy at night, according to Bank of America.
AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)

AT&T is a diversified media & entertainment, telecommunications, and technology services provider.
Analyst David Barden is bullish on AT&T after the company recently completed the spin-off of its Warner Media assets to Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: WBD). AT&T has an adjusted 4.7% dividend yield following the spin-off. Barden says the new AT&T has an attractive yield, PE ratio and FCF multiple. In addition, he says its new structure has simplified its business, and it is relatively underweight among institutional investors.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $25 price target for T stock.
