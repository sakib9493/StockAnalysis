Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

It will get you results that beat whatever the banking system gives you.
But for the more savvy investor, the S&P 500 is not where you want to stay if you want to get the most out of your hard-earned money.
Why? The indices are an average of a group of stocks, so investing in an average will mean average results.

The S&P is an average of 500 stocks.
The Nasdaq is an average of 100 stocks.
The Dow Jones is an average of 30 stocks.
