While the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index was nearly double forecast.  However, the news failed to move markets.  
It’s hard to get Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to move 1% but its announcement that it’s hiking its quarterly dividend 11% and starting a $60 billion stock buyback program has the stock on the move. The news helped sustain Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) which appear to be battling downward pressure. Stock index futures are mixed Wednesday morning with the NASDAQ 100 (NQ) and S&P 500 (/ES) on the positive side. 
Meanwhile, the Business Wire reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) announced plans to buy GreenSky (NASDAQ: GSKY) for $2.24 billion. GSKY is the largest fintech platform for home improvement loan origination. The company allows consumers to “pay as you go” using flexible loan products. 
A few Covid stocks are making waves this morning. Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) traded more than 2% higher in pre-market trading on news that the U.S. government purchased an additional 1.4 million doses of its monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19. CureVac’s (NASDAQ: CVAC) vaccine has disappointed in clinical trials leading to the company canceling deals with two manufacturers.
Some gaming stocks are trading lower again because China and Macau want to tighten control over the casino industry. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) fell 10.9% on Tuesday and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) was down 9.6% and both stocks were down 5% in premarket trading. It’s hard to predict regulatory changes so be careful if you’re trying to pick a bottom. 
Other stocks to watch include Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) which climbed 7.8% in premarket trading as the Wall Street Journal reported that hedge fund Elliott Management had more than $1 billion in the stock. And, Squarespace (NYSE: SQSP) because it’s up 4.9% before the open.
Inflating The Numbers
Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected with a seasonally adjusted 0.3% rise in August. July’s CPI rate was 0.5% and June’s was 0.9%. So, August was certainly an improvement. However, inflation has grown 5.3% over the last year, which is being felt by many consumers. 
Core inflation, which excludes more volatile consumer products like food and energy, was up only 0.1% for August, but 4.3% year over year. Slowing price rises is arguably a good sign that the current inflation may only be transitory.
