That saying certainly applies to the executives and other corporate insiders buying and selling shares of their own company's stock.
It's part of an executive's job to paint a rosy public picture of the future of a company, but a CEO's bullish words may not be an accurate reflection of how he or she truly feels about a stock. However, if company insiders are backing up positive words with insider buying, it can be a confirming indication that management is truly bullish enough about the future to put their own skin in the game.
Here are seven stocks that Bank of America analysts recommend that have seen insider ownership increase in the last year.
Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY)
Incyte develops and commercializes oncology therapies.
Analyst Tazeen Ahmad says Jakafi, a medication used to treat certain bone marrow disorders, and additional revenue streams provide a floor under Incyte's valuation, and the company's late-stage dermatology program could be a near-term growth catalyst. In the longer term, Ahmad says Incyte's early stage pipeline is also encouraging. Ahmad says she is particularly bullish on Incyte's potential opportunities in treatment of the skin condition vitiligo. Incyte shares are down 12% in the past year, but insider ownership is up 235.2% in that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $90 price target for INCY stock.
