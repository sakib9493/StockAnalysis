Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

Despite a seven-day up streak, the move may not be as convincing to some investors, so follow-through on Friday could be important. Fortunately, the S&P 500 futures are pointing slightly higher before the market open. However, the Nasdaq Composite (COMP: GIDS) is trending lower with negative news on Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
The owner of social media platform Snapchat, Snap, traded 20% lower in after-hours trading on Thursday after reporting better than expected earnings and revenue but provided a lower-than-expected outlook. The company is projecting much lower sales in the future. One reason for the sales issue is a change in the privacy restriction for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products.
Semiconductor manufacturer Intel beat earnings estimates despite falling short on revenue. Of course, demand for computer chips is still very high, but according to The Wall Street Journal, there’s a 22-week lag between ordering chips and delivering them. Intel does plan to invest $95 billion into increasing chip-production capacity in its European plants to help make up for the semiconductor shortage.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) was able to beat top and bottom-line numbers despite rising food and labor costs. Americans appear to be tiring of their own pandemic cooking and getting more food on the go. The company saw a 15.1% increase in sales, which was much higher than the 13.4% analysts were expecting.
Appliance maker Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) missed on revenue but beat earnings, which took the stock 2.84% lower in after-hours trading. Third-quarter sales were up about 4% on strong consumer demand. Net earnings margins grew despite the rising cost of raw materials. However, the company cut its fiscal year sales growth guidance from 16% to 13% year-over-year but raised its earnings guidance.   
Similar themes of higher costs and supply chain issues continued into Friday morning as companies like Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON), Roper (NYSE: ROP), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), and VF (NYSE: VFC) beat on earnings but missed on revenues as management wrestles with inflation and supply chain issues. However, Financial stocks continue to do well with American Express (NYSE: AXP) beating on both top and bottom-line numbers.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.
