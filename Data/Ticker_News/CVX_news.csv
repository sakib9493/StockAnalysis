They’re under pressure early despite Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) impressive earnings yesterday, with signs of a bit of slowness in China’s economy dragging things lower. 
China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning. Any rally back toward 1.7% or above could grab traders’ attention after the dovish Fed meeting ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20890262

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction.
In a 1985 article published in the Washington Post, Ivan Boesky was described retreating from his palatial office on New York’s Fifth Avenue by midday and heading for the Harvard Club, where he conducted meetings with staff and clients well into the evening.
“The club suits well the image that Boesky cultivates in interviews and public appearances,” the Post profile exclaimed. “It is a stately and comfortable place, suggestive of a quiet Victorian eminence not ordinarily associated with the ruthless, turbulent world of hostile corporate takeovers where Boesky has made his fortune.”
The Harvard Club is an independent social club that is not formally associated with its namesake university, although its alumni are the core of its membership.
The Post added a slightly sour post-script to its description: Boesky was not a Harvard graduate, nor did he ever complete his undergraduate studies.
Instead, the newspaper diplomatically noted his “main Harvard connection is a fellowship for journalists in public health studies that he has funded at the university."" Or, to translate from politeness to cruelty, he bought his way into the Ivy League surroundings.
Some historians have compared Boesky’s ties to the Harvard Club to the alleged Oxford University ties promulgated by the title character of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” After all, both were outsiders trying to force their way into an upper-class social sphere that was not entirely eager for their acquaintance.
But whereas Fitzgerald’s Gatsby was a tragic figure fueled by unrequited love, Boesky was a parvenu whose narcissism and recklessness took him on a journey of rags to riches to prison.
The Roots Of Bad Behavior: Ivan Frederick Boesky was born March 6, 1937, in Detroit, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father owned a network of delicatessens, restaurants and bars that were popular throughout the city.
When he was 12, Boesky enrolled at Cranbrook, a prestigious private school where he pushed his slight physical stature through excessive exercise to become a trophy-winning member of the wrestling team. He abruptly left Cranbrook in his sophomore year and enrolled at a public school.
Although he never spoke publicly of the change in schools and would always give the impression of being a Cranbrook alum, an unnamed family member, cited in a 1993 Vanity Fair profile of Boesky, insisted he was expelled for cheating.
Indeed, the young Boesky didn’t seem very interested in playing by rules. He drove an ice cream truck in his teen years, but kept staying out late into the evening and far beyond the curfew limit of his driving permit. After being taken to police stations to be bailed out by his father, Boesky simply borrowed the driver’s license of his sweetheart, Seema Silberstein — licenses in those days did not carry a photograph or gender identification and Boesky correctly guessed police officers would not realize Seema’s uncommon first name belonged to a girl.

After a slew of earnings reports, economic releases, and a Fed meeting, the end of the week—and month—was in sight. But if the overnight weakness carries over into the trading day, it could be a weak finish to what had been a strong month.  
One catalyst has been yesterday’s earnings report from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which were solid, but not the full-on blowout the street was expecting. Although earnings beat estimates, it was the missed revenue expectations and downside Q3 guidance that sent shares lower in aftermarket trading. AMZN’s stock price fell as low as about 7% after the close. 
Futures on the major indices fell in overnight trading, with the tech-centric Nasdaq-100 (/NQ) taking the biggest hit, down well over 1% at one point. Equity index futures are lower ahead of the open with the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) set to open down about 1.2%. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which have a high weighting in the NDX and other indices, are all set to open lower. With index weakness—plus a 10-year yield back below 1.25% and pop in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) approaching 20, it’s looking like a “risk-off” start to the day.  
Beyond The FAANGs
The five FAANGs earnings may be out of the way but there’s a lot more coming up. Earnings continue to roll in next week, too, but the huge crush of big-Tech reports is out of the way. Some of the key ones to consider watching include Uber (NYSE: UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Hyatt Hotels (NYSE: H), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), and Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR).
There’s plenty of data on the calendar, too. None arguably more important than what’s on the schedule a week from today when investors get a look at the July payrolls report.
As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week, the jobs picture is improving but is far from being all the way back from Covid. Last month’s 5.9% unemployment rate actually ticked a bit higher from May, to 5.9% from 5.8%. Jobs growth in June was very strong at 850,000, but economic bulls would probably like to see a couple of strong reports strung together. Data have been kind of lumpy so far this year.
We’ll look at analysts’ outlook for jobs and wage growth next week. Besides that key report, other important numbers to watch include Monday’s July ISM Manufacturing figure. It was a strong 60.6% the prior month, but that’s diminished from the spring peaks. Any number above 50% indicates expansion. With Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) a little soft, that could elevate the importance of the ISM number for those trying to get a sense of where the economy has been.
Yesterday’s GDP and jobs numbers didn’t seem to hurt the stock markets too much.

What Happened: In the article “How Green is Blue Hydrogen?”, authors Robert W. Howarth and Mark Z. Jacobson — professors at Cornell University and Stanford University, respectively — took aim at the so-called “blue hydrogen.""
Blue hydrogen is derived from a steam methane reforming process that combines natural gas with scalding steam in the presence of a catalyst that results in a chemical reaction creating hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Adding more water to the mixture turns the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, thus generating creating more hydrogen.
The problem with the process, according to the professors’ report, is it requires a large expenditure of energy to obtain and winds up generating creates 20% more greenhouse gases than coal and 60% more than burning diesel.
“Far from being low carbon, greenhouse gas emissions from the production of blue hydrogen are quite high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane,” the report stated. “While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture.”
The professors added that their “analysis assumes that captured carbon dioxide can be stored indefinitely, an optimistic and unproven assumption. ...","['News', 'Government', 'Regulations', 'Commodities', 'Politics', 'Top Stories', 'Markets', 'General']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22490967

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The second quarter of 2021 was another big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the second half of 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros buying.
Alibaba had a brutal quarter in part due to a regulatory crackdown on big tech stocks in China, and fund managers took notice. Tepper was selling while Cooperman was buying the dip.
Buffett continued accumulating Kroger shares while selling off health care investments.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite a booming U.S. Market, Cooperman invested in developed markets outside of the U.S. & Canada by buying the EFA ETF, while Smith made big bets on small and mid-cap stocks by buying the IWR and IWM funds.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

While the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index was nearly double forecast.  However, the news failed to move markets.  
It’s hard to get Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to move 1% but its announcement that it’s hiking its quarterly dividend 11% and starting a $60 billion stock buyback program has the stock on the move. The news helped sustain Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) which appear to be battling downward pressure. Stock index futures are mixed Wednesday morning with the NASDAQ 100 (NQ) and S&P 500 (/ES) on the positive side. 
Meanwhile, the Business Wire reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) announced plans to buy GreenSky (NASDAQ: GSKY) for $2.24 billion. GSKY is the largest fintech platform for home improvement loan origination. The company allows consumers to “pay as you go” using flexible loan products. 
A few Covid stocks are making waves this morning. Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) traded more than 2% higher in pre-market trading on news that the U.S. government purchased an additional 1.4 million doses of its monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19. CureVac’s (NASDAQ: CVAC) vaccine has disappointed in clinical trials leading to the company canceling deals with two manufacturers.
Some gaming stocks are trading lower again because China and Macau want to tighten control over the casino industry. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) fell 10.9% on Tuesday and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) was down 9.6% and both stocks were down 5% in premarket trading. It’s hard to predict regulatory changes so be careful if you’re trying to pick a bottom. 
Other stocks to watch include Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) which climbed 7.8% in premarket trading as the Wall Street Journal reported that hedge fund Elliott Management had more than $1 billion in the stock. And, Squarespace (NYSE: SQSP) because it’s up 4.9% before the open.
Inflating The Numbers
Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected with a seasonally adjusted 0.3% rise in August. July’s CPI rate was 0.5% and June’s was 0.9%. So, August was certainly an improvement. However, inflation has grown 5.3% over the last year, which is being felt by many consumers. 
Core inflation, which excludes more volatile consumer products like food and energy, was up only 0.1% for August, but 4.3% year over year. Slowing price rises is arguably a good sign that the current inflation may only be transitory.

In a blunt and unpleasant reminder of how crises thousands of miles away can puncture the heart of the U.S. markets, a real estate crisis in Hong Kong took much of the blame for the sharpest daily losses in more than two months for the major U.S. indices. The so-called “horsemen of risk” like bonds, volatility, the U.S. dollar, and “defensive” stock sectors climbed back into the saddle after months of lazing around the corral.

The company cited high demand for its athletic gear, but the broken supply chain is giving Nike issues in Vietnam and Indonesia. However, chemical company H. B. Fuller (NYSE: FUL) traded 2% higher in pre-market trading on better than expected revenues. Costco (NASDAQ: COST) also traded higher before the open with better-than-expected revenues but warned that inflation, higher labor costs, higher freight and transportation costs, and supply chain delays could slow them down.
Fed members including Chair Jerome Powell are hitting the speaker circuit on Friday. Investors will likely listen in for more clues on the taper timeline. August's new home sales will report after the opening. It’s likely that the report will be similar to the building permits report earlier in the week, indicating higher demand but an inability to get construction supplies.  
Stocks rallied on Thursday without the leadership of the FAANG stocks. Instead, upbeat guidance from Accenture (NYSE: ACN), Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI), and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) appeared to help lead the charge.
Energy stocks provided a lift too. The Energy Select Sector Index ($IXE) was the top group rising about 3.5% in response to a 1.2% rally in oil prices (/CL). Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) were among the leaders in the sector.  
Rising oil in the wake of the Fed’s more hawkish stance pushed the 10-Year Treasury Index (TNX) up more than 5.5%. Rising yields helped spark a rally in the Financial Select Sector Index ($IXM) which includes companies like Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) were among the financial top performers.
The bulls were able to make some technical gains. The S&P 500 (SPX) filled Monday’s gap down and reclaim the 50-day moving average. Apparently, “buy the dip” is not dead yet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell appears to have been just hawkish enough for bond traders but accommodative enough for stock traders. The Fed’s messaging, the low likelihood of contagion with Evergrande’s debt issues, and downtrending jobless claims seem to be giving the bulls are reason to charge.

The rallies add to a week where inflation may play a big part. On Wednesday the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released along with the FOMC Meeting Minutes that could provide insights into where the Fed governors see inflation going.
Investors must digest the information from a busy economic calendar along with the unofficial start of earnings season this Wednesday when JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL), and others announce their third-quarter results. Additionally, Monday starts with a closed bond market in recognition of the Columbus Day holiday. This could result in lower volumes for stock trading. Lower volumes can increase the risk in trading which is why many traders may choose to reduce the size of their trades on Monday.
Over the Weekend
Investors already have a lot to digest with a couple of interesting developments over the weekend. First, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) cut its forecast on U.S. economic growth. On Sunday, Reuters reported that declining fiscal support and the trouble getting semiconductors are leading to the slowdown. Additionally, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) had to cancel numerous flights. The company cited weather and personnel scheduling problems.
On the positive side, Morgan Stanley analysts started coverage of SoFi (SOFI) with an overweight rating. SoFi is fintech service company that offers home and personal loans along with credit cards. The company was up more than 4% higher in premarket trading.
Last Friday, investors got a chance to review the disappointing September jobs report, but bond traders didn’t seem to care. The 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) rose 2.16% on Friday, which could suggest that the report wasn’t bad enough to keep the Fed from tapering its bond-buying program. 
While the headline “194,000 jobs created” was less than half of what was expected, the report came with upward revisions to the August jobs report, which means the quarter may have been better than initially thought. Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, which was also better than expected, although much of that was people leaving the workforce which means they’re no longer counted in the report as part of the workforce. Nonetheless, there are enough positives that bond investors appear to be preparing for the Fed to stop buying so many bonds.

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) disappointed investors because of their inability to get products to consumers. This raised concerns about whether brick-and-mortar stores can meet holiday demand. Right now, it’s a cloudy picture.  
One of the most anticipated earnings announcements finally came Thursday after the close when Apple announced better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenue due to lower sales. Apple has been telegraphing that sales would be a problem due to supply chain issues and component factory shutdowns in China over energy shortages. However, the stock still traded 3.4% lower in after-hours trading.
Another highly anticipated report came from Amazon, which was down more than 4% in after-hours trading after missing on earnings and revenue. The company was hurt by product shortages, higher wage costs, higher shipping expenses, and operational investments, but it also emphasized that it’ll do “whatever it takes” to ensure a good holiday season. However, Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing platform, grew by 39%.
Are the FAANG stocks going to have to change their acronym? First, Google changed to Alphabet, and now Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is changing its name to Meta. The new name is meant to reflect the company’s goal on metaverse and not just the Facebook social media app. The metaverse includes other social media apps like Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. The company is also changing its stock symbol to “MVRS” starting December 1.
Outside of technology, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) beat on top- and bottom-line estimates but still traded 3.83% lower in after-hours trading. The company continues to feel the negative effects of the pandemic and continues to be hurt by sales in China. Continued COVID-19 outbreaks in China are slowing down consumer spending.
However, the Energy sector is in focus Friday morning as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announce better-than-expected earnings and revenue.

Automaker stocks are also being helped by the news that the U.S. and European Union agreed to a deal on steel and aluminum tariffs. Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) rallied more than 7% on the news.
Crude oil (/CL) was trading slightly higher before the opening bell. Last week, the commodity had its first down week in 10 weeks.
Analysts from Morgan Stanley raised their price target for Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) prompting a rally of more than 2% in premarket trading.  
There are more signs that things are getting back to normal as COVID-19 cases decline. One sign is earnings from global hotel and accommodations search platform trivago N.V. (NASDAQ: TRVG) which posted a profit for the third quarter on higher demand for hotel rooms. People are also getting back into theaters as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) reported strong ticket sales in October.
Vaccine stocks are mixed in premarket trading with Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) rallying more than 11% but Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) is down about 3%. Novavax was able to get its COVID-19 vaccine authorization from Indonesia and submitted data on its vaccine to Canada’s health authorities for approval.

Friday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) shouldn’t stand in the way of any plans by the Fed to reduce its amount of stimulus. On Tuesday, the Fed will get more inflation information with the Producer Price Index (PPI). Then on Wednesday, the retail sales report will be released in the morning, followed by the FOMC interest rate statement in the afternoon. Investors hope the statement will describe any change to the Fed’s tapering plans.
The Fed isn’t the only central bank meeting this week; announcements are also expected from the Bank or England (BoE), European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The Fed is expected to accelerate the pace of reducing its bond-buying economic stimulus program. The Bank of England is expected to stand pat as it waits to see the impact of the Omicron variant on the United Kingdom’s economy, but the BoE is feeling pressure to raise rates to combat inflation. The ECB is expected to follow the Fed’s lead by reducing its bond-buying programs. The BoJ may stand alone because it’s expected to continue with its low-rate policy.
Stocks added mild gains to a relatively solid week on Friday. Technology and consumer staples were the top-performing sectors of the day. The United States saw inflation grow at a rate of 6.8% from a year ago—the highest rate in nearly 40 years. However, inflation grew at a slower pace than it did in October, which many investors saw as a good sign that inflation may continue to slow after the holiday shopping season.
Some stocks that are moving on Monday morning include Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARNA), which is expected to be acquired by Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) for $100 per share.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of 30 stocks on a price-weighted basis.
The index has changed its holdings many times throughout history and tries to provide a balanced look at top sectors and value names. Many of the companies included in the index pay quarterly dividends.
At the time of writing, 27 of the 30 holdings pay dividends. Boeing Inc (NYSE: BA) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) suspended dividend payouts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) does not pay a dividend.
The average dividend yield is 2.4% of the 30 stocks in the index.

Many stores and restaurants In New York and New Jersey are shutting down. Other countries are imposing stronger restrictions like the Netherlands which reimposed a lockdown of all nonessential shops, bars, and restaurants closed until mid-January.
COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) announced that its third vaccine dose was effective against the Omicron variant. The stock was trading 7.28% higher in premarket trading.
Oil futures (/CL) also fell 4.69% down below $70 on Omicron fears. Winter already tends to see lower demand for crude because fewer people in the Northern Hemisphere travel during winter months despite the holiday season. Omicron could cut demand even further if holiday travel plans are canceled.
Falling oil prices have pulled Chevron (NYSE: CVX) 1.77% lower in premarket trading. The stock is one of the stocks that was weighing down the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) 1.23% before the open.
The Build Back Better bill received another blow over the weekend that could have investors concerned about a lack of stimulus spending. Senator Joe Manchin (D., WV) told reporters that he wouldn’t support the bill because of concerns that it would add to the already growing inflation problem in the United States. According to the Wall Street Journal, the loss of Mr. Manchin’s vote will likely doom the $2 trillion dollar bill. With the Fed tapering its stimulus plans and the inability to get the spending bill passed, investors appeared to be concerned about the economy.
The news around Omicron and the failure of the Build Back Better bill appear to have increased the degree of uncertainty that investors are feeling. The Cboe Market Volatility Index or VIX) jumped more than 20% before the open and traded around the 26 levels. However, the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) is only slightly lower and appears to be holding at a long-term support level. This may suggest that bond investors aren’t as nervous as stock investors about the weekend’s developments.
After Monday’s close, there are two more stragglers of interest announcing earnings: Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU). News from Nike has been helpful in measuring supply chain issues and Micron produces a semiconductor that could help provide more insights into the chip shortages that are holding back many companies from meeting customer demand.

The Japanese yen is now trading at a three-year low against the dollar. The U.S. dollar Index ($DXY) is working on a two-day rally against a basket of other currencies.
The falling yen prompted a rally in Japanese markets. The Nikkei 225 (N225:JP) rose 1.77% overnight. Japan hasn’t had the same inflationary problems as other countries, so the Bank of Japan is still pushing economic stimulus. If the yen continues to weaken, it could help the Nikkei 225 continue to gain ground.  
Equity index futures were trading higher before the bell as stocks hit the final official day of the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 futures (/ES) rose a quarter of a percent in premarket action. If investors follow through after the opening bell, the S&P 500 could be set to create another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) were also up 0.27% in premarket trading and looking to create a new all-time high too.
Energy stocks could lead other sectors again on Tuesday because crude oil futures (/CL) were also trading higher on Tuesday morning rising 1.13% in premarket trading. The commodity looks to be bouncing off an important support level. Consumer staples could also be set up for a good day because some of its companies are seeing analyst upgrades. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) was upgraded by Guggenheim from neutral to a buy. Yesterday, McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) was upgraded too.
Investors appear to be unconcerned about rising COVID-19 cases. According to data from John Hopkins University, more than 1 million more cases were reported on Monday. One reason the numbers were higher was because of a delay in reporting from some U.S. states. The Omicron variant continues to spread but the case doesn’t seem to be as severe as the Delta variant.
In fact, cruise line Carnival (NYSE: CCL) was among several travel and leisure stocks climbing in premarket trading. Travel and leisure have been among the hardest companies hit by COVID-19 because it has hit all workers including pilots, flight attendants, baggage handlers, and more.  
The airline was able to influence a dispute between the United States government and AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) over the companies’ 5G plans and how they might affect airline safety. The telecom companies were providing an alternative plan. But after airline unions started speaking up over the safety issues, AT&T and Verizon decided to push ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Health Care', 'Futures', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Travel', 'Treasuries', 'Global', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/24880540

More than twice as many workers as expected found jobs last month, particularly in leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation, and utilities. Much of these gains may have occurred before the Omicron variant really hit the scene so we’ll have to wait and see if they stick.
Later today, the FOMC Meeting Minutes will be released and investors will have insight into what the Fed has been discussing, particularly related to tapering and future interest rate hikes.
The Nasdaq-100 Futures (/NQ) are leading the slide on Wednesday once again. The Cboe Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN)—also known as the Vixen—is the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) equivalent of the VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index), which is related to the S&P 500 (SPX). The Vixen rose 5.43% on Tuesday as investors sold tech stocks. While this may signal trouble for some tech companies, the fact that the VIX was relatively unchanged could be a good sign for the majority of stocks in the near term.  
One company that struggled to grow on Tuesday was Scott’s Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG). Scott’s fell 2.79% after providing guidance saying it would maintain its full-year earnings outlook, but its Hawthorne cannabis division expects a 40% decline in sales. The company cited the slowdown in the cannabis market and issues with the supply chain.
The ISM Manufacturing PMI was lower than expected, suggesting that manufacturers are seeing fewer orders. December was the 19th straight month of increases, but the slowdown may actually be a welcomed reprieve because it may provide relief to an already strained supply chain.
The JOLTS report also showed a decrease in job openings in November. The Great Resignation continues as the “quits” rate remained high. In the light of Wednesday’s ADP report, it may be that workers were simply quitting one job to take another job. Friday’s Employment Situation report could provide greater insights to these job market developments.
Many stocks turned bearish after the manufacturing and job opening announcements; the S&P 500 (SPX) was positioned for a new all-time high, but it turned negative ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Regulations', 'Bonds', 'Health Care', 'Futures', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Treasuries', 'Global', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/24908134

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

A recently disclosed transaction by a member of Congress shows there continues to be conflicts of interest in pushing for policies that could benefit investment holdings.
What Happened: Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing the state of Rhode Island, purchased shares of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) on Jan. 28, 2022.
The purchase was for shares valued in a range of $15,001 to $50,000.
The move follows other members of Congress including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) who have taken positions in the electric vehicle leader.
Pelosi purchased calls prior to the unveiling of new clean energy initiatives and electric vehicle credits. Crenshaw bought shares of Tesla and then publicly supported a move of Tesla from California to Texas.

The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ...","['News', 'Penny Stocks', 'ESG', 'Specialty ETFs', 'Small Cap', 'Top Stories', 'SEC', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas', 'ETFs']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/26241953

At one point in 2021, Musk was worth as much as all the MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL teams combined.
Here’s a look at how quickly Musk could become a trillionaire and if he is on pace to be the first to hit this new status.
Who Could Be First Trillionaire?: John D. Rockefeller became the first billionaire in the world in 1916. Rockefeller was the founder of Standard Oil, an oil giant that was later split due to antitrust concerns.
Standard Oil is now represented by Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), BP plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), which all own pieces of Rockefeller's former company. 
It took another 83 years before someone passed the $100 billion wealth mark: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
There are now nine centibillionaires with several of them having a shot at hitting the trillion-dollar wealth level.

This has been the looming question on the minds of Americans since inflation topped at 8.5% in March, matched with other indicators such as rising interest rates and the bond market’s inverted yield curve.
Top economists are split on the inevitability of a recession. Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said over the weekend, “It’s certainly a very, very high-risk factor,” but believes that the Fed is responding well to the risk.
Moody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) chief economist Mark Zandi predicted a 35% probability that America will enter a recession in the next two years. Twitter Inc.'s (NYSE: TWTR) most-loved Elon Musk predicted a recession as early as the summer of 2022.
Conflicting outlooks aside, it is essential to look at the facts and what has historically preceded a recession.
The yield curve inverted on March 29 for the first time since 2019. This occurs when the short-term U.S. treasury is paying a higher interest rate than long-term U.S. treasuries.

This week, the duel is between two energy industry giants: Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM).
The Case For Chevron: This company’s heritage can be found in the 1876 discovery of oil in the Los Angeles-area Pico Canyon Oilfield by Star Oil, which was acquired three years later by the Pacific Coast Oil Company — itself later acquired by John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil in 1900. That company became an independent entity when the federal government broke up Standard Oil’s monopoly in 1911, evolving over the years into Chevron. A 1984 merger with Gulf Oil and the 2000 acquisition of Texaco increased the company’s dominant force in the energy industry.

Among its recent corporate developments, Chevron announced on Monday it completed its previously announced acquisition of Renewable Energy Group Inc (NASDAQ: REGI) for $3.15 billion. Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said the acquired company was “a founder of the renewable fuels industry and has been a leading innovator ever since. Together, we can grow more quickly and efficiently than either could on its own.”
Other developments where Chevron has demonstrated a commitment to move away from fossil fuels included an agreement from last week to supply fuel linked to renewable natural gas for a Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) demonstration of Cummins Inc.’s (NYSE: CMI) new 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks.
The company also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kazakh JSC National Company (also known as KazMunayGas) to explore potential lower carbon business opportunities in Kazakhstan and it joined the Global Center for Maritime Decarbonization to help support the development of potentially scalable lower-carbon technologies, including those that enable the use of ammonia as a maritime fuel.
