Analyst Andrew Didora says Alaska is 50% hedged against surging fuel costs, and it's highly exposed to leisure travel, a trend he expects will dominate the industry in the next three months.

Bank of America has a Buy rating and $70 price target for ALK stock.

But for the more savvy investor, the S&P 500 is not where you want to stay if you want to get the most out of your hard-earned money.

The Dow Jones is an average of 30 stocks.
