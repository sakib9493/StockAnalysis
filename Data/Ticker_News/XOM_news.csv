They’re under pressure early despite Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) impressive earnings yesterday, with signs of a bit of slowness in China’s economy dragging things lower. 
China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning. Any rally back toward 1.7% or above could grab traders’ attention after the dovish Fed meeting ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20890262

The past week's bullish calls included oil, automaker and semiconductor giants.

E-commerce and electric vehicle leaders and a FAANG stock were among the bearish calls seen.

After a slew of earnings reports, economic releases, and a Fed meeting, the end of the week—and month—was in sight. But if the overnight weakness carries over into the trading day, it could be a weak finish to what had been a strong month.  
One catalyst has been yesterday’s earnings report from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which were solid, but not the full-on blowout the street was expecting. Although earnings beat estimates, it was the missed revenue expectations and downside Q3 guidance that sent shares lower in aftermarket trading. AMZN’s stock price fell as low as about 7% after the close. 
Futures on the major indices fell in overnight trading, with the tech-centric Nasdaq-100 (/NQ) taking the biggest hit, down well over 1% at one point. Equity index futures are lower ahead of the open with the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) set to open down about 1.2%. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which have a high weighting in the NDX and other indices, are all set to open lower. With index weakness—plus a 10-year yield back below 1.25% and pop in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) approaching 20, it’s looking like a “risk-off” start to the day.  
Beyond The FAANGs
The five FAANGs earnings may be out of the way but there’s a lot more coming up. Earnings continue to roll in next week, too, but the huge crush of big-Tech reports is out of the way. Some of the key ones to consider watching include Uber (NYSE: UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Hyatt Hotels (NYSE: H), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), and Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR).
There’s plenty of data on the calendar, too. None arguably more important than what’s on the schedule a week from today when investors get a look at the July payrolls report.
As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week, the jobs picture is improving but is far from being all the way back from Covid. Last month’s 5.9% unemployment rate actually ticked a bit higher from May, to 5.9% from 5.8%. Jobs growth in June was very strong at 850,000, but economic bulls would probably like to see a couple of strong reports strung together. Data have been kind of lumpy so far this year.
We’ll look at analysts’ outlook for jobs and wage growth next week. Besides that key report, other important numbers to watch include Monday’s July ISM Manufacturing figure. It was a strong 60.6% the prior month, but that’s diminished from the spring peaks. Any number above 50% indicates expansion. With Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) a little soft, that could elevate the importance of the ISM number for those trying to get a sense of where the economy has been.
Yesterday’s GDP and jobs numbers didn’t seem to hurt the stock markets too much. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) and S&P ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Biotech', 'Health Care', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Travel', 'Treasuries', 'Markets', 'General']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22248804

In fact, in WTI crude oil prices briefly dropped below $0 during the worst of the pandemic sell-off as demand plummeted and oil buyers ran out of storage space.

In a blunt and unpleasant reminder of how crises thousands of miles away can puncture the heart of the U.S. markets, a real estate crisis in Hong Kong took much of the blame for the sharpest daily losses in more than two months for the major U.S. indices. The so-called “horsemen of risk” like bonds, volatility, the U.S. dollar, and “defensive” stock sectors climbed back into the saddle after months of lazing around the corral.
While analysts mainly cited the issues around Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail, that wasn’t the only issue sending a shudder around the world today. Though it should be noted that a default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders not just in Asia but throughout the globe. Reuters reported that Evergrande bonds were trading for 29 cents on the dollar on Monday.

This includes technology, gambling, and video games. Remember, markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday, so we could see increased action and volatility overnight when the market opens tonight.
Worries about the default and its possible side effects could help explain why Financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) were among those taking the most heat Monday. Also, Energy got clobbered as crude sank amid global growth fears. Crude oil futures (/CL) tested the $70 level before moving a little higher on a down day. And the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) traded above 28 but fell to just below ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Futures', 'Commodities', 'Global', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/23022505

The company cited high demand for its athletic gear, but the broken supply chain is giving Nike issues in Vietnam and Indonesia. However, chemical company H. B. Fuller (NYSE: FUL) traded 2% higher in pre-market trading on better than expected revenues. Costco (NASDAQ: COST) also traded higher before the open with better-than-expected revenues but warned that inflation, higher labor costs, higher freight and transportation costs, and supply chain delays could slow them down.
Fed members including Chair Jerome Powell are hitting the speaker circuit on Friday. Investors will likely listen in for more clues on the taper timeline. August's new home sales will report after the opening. It’s likely that the report will be similar to the building permits report earlier in the week, indicating higher demand but an inability to get construction supplies.  
Stocks rallied on Thursday without the leadership of the FAANG stocks. Instead, upbeat guidance from Accenture (NYSE: ACN), Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI), and Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) appeared to help lead the charge.
Energy stocks provided a lift too. The Energy Select Sector Index ($IXE) was the top group rising about 3.5% in response to a 1.2% rally in oil prices (/CL). Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) were among the leaders in the sector.  
Rising oil in the wake of the Fed’s more hawkish stance pushed the 10-Year Treasury Index (TNX) up more than 5.5%. Rising yields helped spark a rally in the Financial Select Sector Index ($IXM) which includes companies like Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) were among the financial top performers.
The bulls were able to make some technical gains. The S&P 500 (SPX) filled Monday’s gap down and reclaim the 50-day moving average. Apparently, “buy the dip” is not dead yet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell appears to have been just hawkish enough for bond traders but accommodative enough for stock traders. The Fed’s messaging, the low likelihood of contagion with Evergrande’s debt issues, and downtrending jobless claims seem to be giving the bulls are reason to charge.

The rallies add to a week where inflation may play a big part. On Wednesday the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released along with the FOMC Meeting Minutes that could provide insights into where the Fed governors see inflation going.
Investors must digest the information from a busy economic calendar along with the unofficial start of earnings season this Wednesday when JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL), and others announce their third-quarter results. Additionally, Monday starts with a closed bond market in recognition of the Columbus Day holiday. This could result in lower volumes for stock trading. Lower volumes can increase the risk in trading which is why many traders may choose to reduce the size of their trades on Monday.
Over the Weekend
Investors already have a lot to digest with a couple of interesting developments over the weekend. First, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) cut its forecast on U.S. economic growth. On Sunday, Reuters reported that declining fiscal support and the trouble getting semiconductors are leading to the slowdown. Additionally, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) had to cancel numerous flights. The company cited weather and personnel scheduling problems.
On the positive side, Morgan Stanley analysts started coverage of SoFi (SOFI) with an overweight rating. SoFi is fintech service company that offers home and personal loans along with credit cards. The company was up more than 4% higher in premarket trading.
Last Friday, investors got a chance to review the disappointing September jobs report, but bond traders didn’t seem to care. The 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) rose 2.16% on Friday, which could suggest that the report wasn’t bad enough to keep the Fed from tapering its bond-buying program. 
While the headline “194,000 jobs created” was less than half of what was expected, the report came with upward revisions to the August jobs report, which means the quarter may have been better than initially thought. Additionally, the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, which was also better than expected, although much of that was people leaving the workforce which means they’re no longer counted in the report as part of the workforce. Nonetheless, there are enough positives that bond investors appear to be preparing for the Fed to stop buying so many bonds.

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) disappointed investors because of their inability to get products to consumers. This raised concerns about whether brick-and-mortar stores can meet holiday demand. Right now, it’s a cloudy picture.  
One of the most anticipated earnings announcements finally came Thursday after the close when Apple announced better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenue due to lower sales. Apple has been telegraphing that sales would be a problem due to supply chain issues and component factory shutdowns in China over energy shortages. However, the stock still traded 3.4% lower in after-hours trading.
Another highly anticipated report came from Amazon, which was down more than 4% in after-hours trading after missing on earnings and revenue. The company was hurt by product shortages, higher wage costs, higher shipping expenses, and operational investments, but it also emphasized that it’ll do “whatever it takes” to ensure a good holiday season. However, Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing platform, grew by 39%.
Are the FAANG stocks going to have to change their acronym? First, Google changed to Alphabet, and now Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is changing its name to Meta. The new name is meant to reflect the company’s goal on metaverse and not just the Facebook social media app. The metaverse includes other social media apps like Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. The company is also changing its stock symbol to “MVRS” starting December 1.
Outside of technology, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) beat on top- and bottom-line estimates but still traded 3.83% lower in after-hours trading. The company continues to feel the negative effects of the pandemic and continues to be hurt by sales in China. Continued COVID-19 outbreaks in China are slowing down consumer spending.
However, the Energy sector is in focus Friday morning as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announce better-than-expected earnings and revenue.

Automaker stocks are also being helped by the news that the U.S. and European Union agreed to a deal on steel and aluminum tariffs. Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG) rallied more than 7% on the news.
Crude oil (/CL) was trading slightly higher before the opening bell. Last week, the commodity had its first down week in 10 weeks.
Analysts from Morgan Stanley raised their price target for Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) prompting a rally of more than 2% in premarket trading.  
There are more signs that things are getting back to normal as COVID-19 cases decline. One sign is earnings from global hotel and accommodations search platform trivago N.V. (NASDAQ: TRVG) which posted a profit for the third quarter on higher demand for hotel rooms. People are also getting back into theaters as AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) reported strong ticket sales in October.
Vaccine stocks are mixed in premarket trading with Novavax (NASDAQ: NVAX) rallying more than 11% but Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) is down about 3%. Novavax was able to get its COVID-19 vaccine authorization from Indonesia and submitted data on its vaccine to Canada’s health authorities for approval. But Moderna reported that the FDA needed more time to review the use of its COVID-19 vaccine for 12 to 17-year-olds.
As expected, the FDA authorized the use of the Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children ages five to 11 late on Friday. However, only Pfizer rallied on the news. BioNTech dropped 1.85%. Because the news came as no surprise, the market may have already discounted the development.
Is 2022 the Year of Buybacks? 
On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs Strategists see a lot of S&P 500 (SPX) companies flush with cash, which will likely be used for stock buyback or repurchase plans.

Friday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) shouldn’t stand in the way of any plans by the Fed to reduce its amount of stimulus. On Tuesday, the Fed will get more inflation information with the Producer Price Index (PPI). Then on Wednesday, the retail sales report will be released in the morning, followed by the FOMC interest rate statement in the afternoon. Investors hope the statement will describe any change to the Fed’s tapering plans.
The Fed isn’t the only central bank meeting this week; announcements are also expected from the Bank or England (BoE), European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The Fed is expected to accelerate the pace of reducing its bond-buying economic stimulus program. The Bank of England is expected to stand pat as it waits to see the impact of the Omicron variant on the United Kingdom’s economy, but the BoE is feeling pressure to raise rates to combat inflation. The ECB is expected to follow the Fed’s lead by reducing its bond-buying programs. The BoJ may stand alone because it’s expected to continue with its low-rate policy.
Stocks added mild gains to a relatively solid week on Friday. Technology and consumer staples were the top-performing sectors of the day. The United States saw inflation grow at a rate of 6.8% from a year ago—the highest rate in nearly 40 years. However, inflation grew at a slower pace than it did in October, which many investors saw as a good sign that inflation may continue to slow after the holiday shopping season.
Some stocks that are moving on Monday morning include Arena Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARNA), which is expected to be acquired by Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) for $100 per share.

The last time the Bulldogs won a national championship was following the 1980 season, and a lot has changed in the U.S. economy since that time.
1980 And Today: The Bulldogs defeated Notre Dame 17-10 in the Sugar Bowl to win their last national championship on Jan. 1, 1981. At that time, the S&P 500 was trading at 135.7 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at 963.99.
A $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 the day Georgia won their last championship would be worth more than $34,300 today.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ...","['News', 'Penny Stocks', 'ESG', 'Specialty ETFs', 'Small Cap', 'Top Stories', 'SEC', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas', 'ETFs']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/26241953

At one point in 2021, Musk was worth as much as all the MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL teams combined.
Here’s a look at how quickly Musk could become a trillionaire and if he is on pace to be the first to hit this new status.
Who Could Be First Trillionaire?: John D. Rockefeller became the first billionaire in the world in 1916. Rockefeller was the founder of Standard Oil, an oil giant that was later split due to antitrust concerns.
Standard Oil is now represented by Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), BP plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE: MPC), which all own pieces of Rockefeller's former company. 
It took another 83 years before someone passed the $100 billion wealth mark: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
There are now nine centibillionaires with several of them having a shot at hitting the trillion-dollar wealth level.

(Friday Market Open) Another day, another round of earnings reports. However, the dark cloud of rising interest rates appears to be hanging over investors as equity index futures point to a lower open. Even the “happiest place on earth” is facing another storm.
Potential Market Movers
Disney (DIS) has lost ground after revelations from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) that its streaming service had lost subscribers and expects to lose many more. Now, the Florida legislature has voted to end Disney’s 50-year-old special self-governing district by June 1, 2023. The self-governing district allowed Disney to collect taxes, provide emergency services, and build new structures without local government approval. However, according to CNBC, the move may result in Florida taxpayers absorbing a $1 billion bond debt. There’s also the question of whether Florida will now be entitled to the additional tax revenue that the special Disney district was collecting as well as building and permit fees. Obviously, there’s a lot more to come on this story and how it will  affect Disney going forward.
While Disney is dealing with its own issues, the rest of the market will likely be undergoing another revaluation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s more hawkish tone on Thursday caused stocks to fall and yields to rise. On the bright side, the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) was down about 16 basis points in premarket trading which may take some of the sting out of valuation calculations.
The dreary outlook is even affecting companies with otherwise positive earnings reports. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) reported that it hit analysts’ earnings estimates on the nose and saw better-than-expected revenues, but still fell 1.6% in pre-market trading. VZ issued forward guidance at the lower end of its fiscal 2022 range. The lower guidance came as VZ cut its sales forecast and reported struggles with inflation. One problem Verizon is likely expecting is that budget-conscious consumers will likely be looking for cheaper carrier plans as inflation pushes tighter household purse strings.
American Express (NYSE: AXP) was also trading lower despite beating on top and bottom-line numbers. AXP was down about 1% before the market open when the company failed to raise its earnings outlook and only reaffirmed previous guidance.  
Despite higher gold prices, Newmont (NYSE: NEM) missed on earnings and revenue estimates due to higher extraction and production costs. The company added an additional 5% for costs in its 2022 outlook. Management effectiveness is key in a time of rising input costs, which means NEM managers need to find a way to cut costs elsewhere if possible. Newmont was down 4.1% in premarket trading, adding to its Thursday loss of 6.7%.
One company that appears to be managing costs while benefiting from higher commodity prices is Schlumberger (NYSE: SL). Not only did the company beat ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Opinion', 'Economics']",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/26763323

This week, the duel is between two energy industry giants: Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM).
The Case For Chevron: This company’s heritage can be found in the 1876 discovery of oil in the Los Angeles-area Pico Canyon Oilfield by Star Oil, which was acquired three years later by the Pacific Coast Oil Company — itself later acquired by John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil in 1900. That company became an independent entity when the federal government broke up Standard Oil’s monopoly in 1911, evolving over the years into Chevron. A 1984 merger with Gulf Oil and the 2000 acquisition of Texaco increased the company’s dominant force in the energy industry.

Among its recent corporate developments, Chevron announced on Monday it completed its previously announced acquisition of Renewable Energy Group Inc (NASDAQ: REGI) for $3.15 billion. Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said the acquired company was “a founder of the renewable fuels industry and has been a leading innovator ever since. Together, we can grow more quickly and efficiently than either could on its own.”
Other developments where Chevron has demonstrated a commitment to move away from fossil fuels included an agreement from last week to supply fuel linked to renewable natural gas for a Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) demonstration of Cummins Inc.’s (NYSE: CMI) new 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks.
The company also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kazakh JSC National Company (also known as KazMunayGas) to explore potential lower carbon business opportunities in Kazakhstan and it joined the Global Center for Maritime Decarbonization to help support the development of potentially scalable lower-carbon technologies, including those that enable the use of ammonia as a maritime fuel.
