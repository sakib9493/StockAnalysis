They’re under pressure early despite Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) impressive earnings yesterday, with signs of a bit of slowness in China’s economy dragging things lower. 
China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning. Any rally back toward 1.7% or above could grab traders’ attention after the dovish Fed meeting ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20890262,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/petrol-996617_1920_21.jpg,"['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']"

That’s because, historically, the strongest period for the market tends to be the stretch between November-April, with May-October lagging, according to The Stock Trader’s Almanac. 
Whether May will be a selling month remains to be seen, but there seems to be a sense that history might repeat given how elevated many stocks are. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP) and S&P 500 Index (SPX) both gained more than 5% in April, with the latter closing at a record high on Thursday before succumbing to some profit-taking on the last trading day of the week.
Selling pressure doesn’t seem to be a feature of this morning’s trading, with the path of least resistance appearing to be to the upside. Investors seem optimistic given the backdrop of a stronger-than-expected earnings season, improving economic data, a strong vaccine rollout in the United States, government stimulus, and easy monetary policy from the Fed.
Earnings Season Going Better Than Expected
With earnings season in full swing, investors have plenty to digest as they try to form a picture of the market in the near term based on corporate performance, executive commentary, and company outlooks. 
Investors can learn a lot from executives during corporate earnings calls discussing the reopening economy and emerging consumer trends they’re seeing.
So far most of the SPX companies that have reported have beaten earnings expectations. On Friday, FactSet said that more SPX companies are beating earnings estimates for the first quarter than average, and that those beats are coming with a wider-than-average margin. 
Of the 60% of SPX companies reporting first-quarter earnings, 86% of them had reported earnings that exceeded estimates, above the five-year average of 74%, FactSet said Friday. (See more on earnings below.)
This week, the earnings parade continues, although it may be less intense than last week. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Uber (NYSE: UBER), PayPal (NASDAQ: Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20916604,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/app-2941689_1920_19.jpg,"['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Commodities', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']"

Tech stocks rose in pre-market trading, but can they maintain those early gains? That’s one question hanging over Wall Street today. 
We’ll talk more about the trauma in Tech lower down. First, let’s take care of some data and earnings business. 
There’s more good news on the jobs front today as initial weekly jobless claims fell to 498,000, well below the 527,000 Wall Street had expected. It’s the fourth week in a row below 600,000 and the first reading below 500,000 since before the pandemic. Having the number come in below 500,000 is going to set up some high expectations for tomorrow’s nonfarm payrolls report. 
On the earnings side of things, Uber (NYSE: UBER) shares didn’t receive the same kind of love in overnight trading as competitor Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) did the night before. Instead, UBER turned lower after the company reported a narrower than expected quarterly loss following the close yesterday. A miss on the revenue line and hints of rising expenses might help explain why investors were less enthusiastic. Most companies missing on revenue have gotten taken out to the woodshed this earnings season.
That’s what’s happening to Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) in pre-market trading, too. Its shares are down 5% following a miss on revenue and a beat on earnings per share for the Covid vaccine company. MRNA, along with BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX)—another Covid vaccine maker—might be getting hurt more by the growing momentum among global policymakers to waive patent protection for Covid vaccine makers. President Biden yesterday added his name to the list of those supporting the idea. 
Another company we’ve heard a lot about over the last year, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), is scheduled to report after the close one day after shares tanked following its treadmill recall. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Square (NYSE: SQ) are other earnings reports to consider watching today, with ROKU another good chance to check how streaming demand is looking. “Gross payment volume,” or GPV, is a key metric to watch when you check SQ’s earnings. 
Stocks have really entered a holding pattern here. If you check the close of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) yesterday vs. its close on April 15, it’s a three-point difference. A holding pattern would probably sound good right now to anyone with lots of Tech stocks in their portfolio. The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is down nearly 4% since April 15. 
Technically, however, both the SPX and the Nasdaq (COMP) have remained above their 50-day moving averages. Any test of those levels could be interesting to watch for signs of either buying the dip or a new wave of selling. The 50-day MA for the SPX is 4019, and for COMP is 13,513. 
Hurry Up And Wait For Jobs Report
Yesterday and today appear to be mostly about range-bound trading ahead of tomorrow’s April payrolls report. As a reminder, consensus on Wall Street is for a gain of one million jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate to 5.8%. 
The same numbers were 916,000 and 6% in March, so we’re talking incremental improvements. Even if the data meet expectations, the economy will remain way behind where it was pre-Covid on the jobs front, so it’s important not to let a few good numbers cause anyone to forget that. 
As always, it’s also important to check the mix when you look at job numbers. In March, most of the growth was concentrated in lower-paying services jobs as reopening gained steam.  Overall wages actually fell. There’s nothing wrong with leisure and hospitality jobs like bar-tending or waiting tables, but it would be better for the economy to see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20991352,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/app-2941689_1920_22.jpg,"['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']"

Some energy companies, including a supermajor, have seen some insider buying.

Chief executive officers were among those stepping up to the buy window during the week.

Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when there is uncertainty in the markets or the markets are near all-time highs.
Note that with earnings-reporting season past its peak, many insiders are free once more to buy or sell shares. Here are a few of the most noteworthy insider purchases that were reported in the past week.
In the latest of a number of purchases stretching back to late May, a Cricut Inc (NASDAQ: CRCT) 10% owner picked up over 1.70 million more shares at prices ranging from $25.00 to $34.60 apiece. These latest purchases added up to over $48.06 million. Note that the stock was trading at less than $28 when that owner began buying the shares, and it has been as high as $47.36 since its initial public offering.

It’s hard to get Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to move 1% but its announcement that it’s hiking its quarterly dividend 11% and starting a $60 billion stock buyback program has the stock on the move. The news helped sustain Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) which appear to be battling downward pressure. Stock index futures are mixed Wednesday morning with the NASDAQ 100 (NQ) and S&P 500 (/ES) on the positive side. 
Meanwhile, the Business Wire reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) announced plans to buy GreenSky (NASDAQ: GSKY) for $2.24 billion. GSKY is the largest fintech platform for home improvement loan origination. The company allows consumers to “pay as you go” using flexible loan products. 
A few Covid stocks are making waves this morning. Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) traded more than 2% higher in pre-market trading on news that the U.S. government purchased an additional 1.4 million doses of its monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19. CureVac’s (NASDAQ: CVAC) vaccine has disappointed in clinical trials leading to the company canceling deals with two manufacturers.
Some gaming stocks are trading lower again because China and Macau want to tighten control over the casino industry. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) fell 10.9% on Tuesday and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) was down 9.6% and both stocks were down 5% in premarket trading. It’s hard to predict regulatory changes so be careful if you’re trying to pick a bottom. 
Other stocks to watch include Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) which climbed 7.8% in premarket trading as the Wall Street Journal reported that hedge fund Elliott Management had more than $1 billion in the stock. And, Squarespace (NYSE: SQSP) because it’s up 4.9% before the open.
Inflating The Numbers
Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected with a seasonally adjusted 0.3% rise in August. July’s CPI rate was 0.5% and June’s was 0.9%. So, August was certainly an improvement. However, inflation has grown 5.3% over the last year, which is being felt by many consumers. 
Core inflation, which excludes more volatile consumer products like food and energy, was up only 0.1% for August, but 4.3% year over year. Slowing price rises is arguably a good sign that the current inflation may only be transitory.

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

Whether the strong start to November will continue is uncertain in this historically strong-performing month, but if it does, it will be the result of how it fares in the face of earnings results, Fed policy, economic reports, and whatever other news we are confronted with. 
For today at least, the name of the game is earnings. Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) beat expectations on the top and bottom line and also raised its full-year outlook. Although the overall sales number didn’t wow as much as some would have liked, it appears they more than made up for it with their brick-and-mortar sales. 
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) released earnings too. The pharmaceutical giant did well, and the market is rewarding their numbers in this morning’s pre-market trading. They reported fiscal Q3 adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share, beating the analysts’ consensus estimate of $1.09 per share. That was also a strong increase from the $0.59 they reported last year. Revenue also beat expectations. 
DuPont de Nemours (NYSE: DD) also had an earnings beat ($1.15 actual v. $1.11 est.) but cut its outlook. The company is a victim of the “supply-chain drain” that we have seen often lately. Conoco Phillips (NYSE: COP) also beat estimates, turning out a $1.77 profit after losing $0.31 a year ago. The company benefited from rising oil prices; however, the stock is mostly unchanged in pre-market trading. 
In non-earnings news, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is down around 4% in pre-market trading after Elon Musk tweeted that the much-hyped deal with Hertz Global hasn’t actually been signed yet.

The geopolitical instability has rattled financial markets, but the energy sector is soaring.
On Wednesday, OPEC and its partners agreed to stick to a previous plan to increase oil output slowly in April, suggesting elevated oil prices may be here to stay for the time being. Oil prices are good news for many companies within the energy sector because it boosts their margins and increases their profitability.
Here are six of the next energy stocks to buy and hold for the long-term, according to Bank of America.
Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
Exxon Mobil is the largest U.S. oil company. Analyst Doug Leggate says Exxon has come a long way from where it was six months ago, when some analysts were calling for a dividend cut. Leggate says Exxon can cover its capex and dividends at a crude oil price of $41/bbl, and he believes Exxon's break-even oil price will be $10 below that level by 2028. Incredibly, Leggate says Exxon is positioned to potentially buy back 30% of its stock by that time.
Bank of America has a Buy rating and $110 price target for XOM stock.

The proposal continues a push in the clean energy sector and could result in winners and losers in different sectors.
What Happened: The SEC made the proposal at an open meeting. Three Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal and one Republican commissioner voted against the proposal.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the proposal would provide “consistent, comparable information” to investors of public companies.
Many environmentalists praised the proposal as an important first step in the fight against climate change. Other environmentalists are pushing for stricter proposals including businesses to disclose emissions from their customers and supply chain partners.
Public companies would have to disclose emissions and the effect on their business to the SEC under the new proposal. Large companies would also have to have emissions numbers verified by an independent auditing firm under the proposal.
Companies would also be forced to disclose if they use carbon offsets to lower emissions.
A 60-day public comment period will open soon on the proposal. The public comment period will be followed by a final vote from the SEC’s four commissioners.
Potential Winners: The Washington Post article on the new proposal highlights several companies that already disclose emissions.
Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) discloses emissions from vehicles and its production facilities. With the company already making these disclosures public, it could help save the company time and money under new rules and also highlight how the company was ahead of the game and had nothing to hide.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) publicly shares the emissions from the Tesla Model 3 car and production facility. The Washington Post report said this is the only vehicle for which Tesla breaks down the full emissions from production to the road.
A report from S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) from earlier this month showed that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), PepsiCo Inc (NYSE: PEP) and Ecolab Inc (NYSE: ECL) received grades of A- by an advocacy group grading emissions disclosures. ...",https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/26241953,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/industry-gfe89ff53f_1920.png,"['News', 'Penny Stocks', 'ESG', 'Specialty ETFs', 'Small Cap', 'Top Stories', 'SEC', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas', 'ETFs']"

It will get you results that beat whatever the banking system gives you.
But for the more savvy investor, the S&P 500 is not where you want to stay if you want to get the most out of your hard-earned money.
Why? The indices are an average of a group of stocks, so investing in an average will mean average results.

The S&P is an average of 500 stocks.
The Nasdaq is an average of 100 stocks.
The Dow Jones is an average of 30 stocks.

To achieve results that outperform the market — something very few manage to do but is far simpler than people ever realize — requires you to be able to scan and analyze for a handful of stocks that are performing better than the average.
