Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The second quarter of 2021 was another big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the second half of 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros buying.
Alibaba had a brutal quarter in part due to a regulatory crackdown on big tech stocks in China, and fund managers took notice. Tepper was selling while Cooperman was buying the dip.
Buffett continued accumulating Kroger shares while selling off health care investments.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite a booming U.S. Market, Cooperman invested in developed markets outside of the U.S. & Canada by buying the EFA ETF, while Smith made big bets on small and mid-cap stocks by buying the IWR and IWM funds.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Last week, Friday brought a critical speech from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This week, the August payrolls report comes Friday and could help shape market action and Fed policy as the month of September starts.
Generally, analysts think another solid jobs report might be the last straw on the camel’s back to get the Fed to start tapering its $120 billion a month bond-buying program. That program was designed to ease borrowing costs and underpin the economy during the pandemic. The last three months saw average job gains of more than 800,000, so judging from those numbers, it looks like the Fed has been moving toward its goal to bring down unemployment. Still, Powell made clear we haven’t come far enough.
We’ll talk more later this week about analysts’ expectations for the August jobs report and how it might be affected by both the Delta variant and wage demands. At an early glance, analysts expect another solid gain of around 750,000 new jobs, according to research firm Briefing.com.
One thing to keep in mind: the employment numbers come on Friday ahead of the Labor Day holiday. Because many traders tend to square up positions and tiptoe out early to enjoy a long weekend, the numbers might need to be either a big hit or a big miss in order to have a major market impact. But it might also mean we see some extra gyrations between now and Friday.
As The Week Begins
But first, we have a few days of market activity ahead. Topping this morning’s newsmakers: Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana last night, exactly 16 years after Katrina rocked the area. While most crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico—and much of the power grid in and around New Orleans—is currently offline, Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm, and initial reports seem to indicate the worst has been spared, particularly those oil rigs.
After last week’s surge in crude oil futures (/CL), Monday started to stabilize, possibly interrupting a rally that had barely clawed above a three-week high, as Hurricane Ida’s tropical downgrade may have eased the energy markets a bit.
Also easing crude concerns, OPEC+ meets Wednesday to discuss a scheduled 400,000 barrels per day output increase; OPEC delegates are likely to give the production ramp-up the green light.
Small-Caps Revive, But Recent Rally Shows Wide Strength
For the moment, that “buy the dip” mentality which so many of us have gotten familiar with over the last few weeks appears to remain front and center. Friday was another example after Thursday’s moderate losses. All but two S&P 500 sectors rose on Friday, with Health Care and Utilities missing out, and “reopening” sectors like Energy and Financials again among the leaders. Those two topped the sector scoreboard last week.
For those keeping score at home, Friday marked the 52nd new high for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) this year, and the 31st new high for the Nasdaq (COMP: GIDS). 
Small-caps also rebounded Friday, a positive sign for anyone worried that a lagging Russell 2000 Index (RUT) might be a harbinger of some kind of broader selloff, as it sometimes has been historically. Recent dollar strength— which tends to help small-caps gain ground over large-caps—may be one reason for RUT’s revival.
Having said that, some of the best-performing stocks on Friday aren’t known for being too small. They included Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Looking at these names, you see a nice sweep across many sectors including oil and gas exploration, mining, hotels and casinos, and semiconductors. It’s just one day, but if the market is healthy, that kind of diversification among the strongest performing stocks is what you often see.
Beyond that, Friday was a good day for the Tech “mega-caps,” too, like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Some analysts had worried that the five or six heavily-weighted mega-caps were too dominant ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Treasuries', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']"

The Delta variant seems to be sinking its teeth into the economy, taking a massive bite into the jobs picture. 
Job gains of 235,000 in August reported today by the U.S. government were more than 500,000 below the average analyst estimate for 750,000, and raise new questions about the pace of economic growth as the country continues to struggle with Covid. Lack of any gains for the Leisure and Hospitality sector played a big role in the disappointing data. 
On the plus side, the Labor Department did raise its estimates for jobs growth in June and July, to 962,000 and 1.1 million, respectively. You can’t necessarily discount the possibility that we could see an upward revision for August next month but, given the impact Leisure & Hospitality had on today’s report (see more below), subsequent reports could hinge on the Delta variant. 
Major indices held pretty steadily after the report—arguably quite a feat given the recent string of record highs. Perhaps it’s one of those times when bad news doesn’t have much of an impact on stock prices, as a report like this could ease fears of any near-term Fed move to pull back on stimulus. Remember, just a week ago Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the Fed could begin tapering its bond-buying program but added that employment hadn’t met the central bank’s goals. This report doesn’t really go very far to meet the Fed’s goal of getting employment back to where it was before Covid.
A Peek Under The Hood Of Today’s Report
Having said all that, remember, this is just one month of data. One month or one report is never a trend. Jobs growth is averaging a healthy 766,000 a month since June, even with today’s disappointing number factored in.
Also, a lot of this miss appeared to be centered in the Leisure and Hospitality space, where employment was unchanged after averaging gains of 350,000 per month over the previous six months. That’s probably the biggest reason for the huge miss in expectations by Wall Street, and likely reflects Delta variant concerns affecting restaurants and hotels. Assuming the country gets a handle on this variant in the coming months, it’s possible jobs growth in this category could rebound pretty quickly, as it often has following disturbances.
It was good to see 37,000 jobs added in manufacturing and 53,000 jobs added in transportation and warehousing during August. Those are categories you like to see going up because they can speak to decent underlying growth in economic demand by businesses and consumers. Also, average hourly earnings rose 0.6%, which was above the 0.3% estimate and might have partly reflected a lack of growth in the low-paying Leisure and Hospitality sector. This isn’t a number that’s likely to have the Fed worried about wage inflation, but it does mean more money going into peoples’ pockets—never a bad thing. 
Also, you can’t overlook that the overall unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% the previous month. That’s the lowest since Covid began. Sometimes, drops in the unemployment rate can reflect discouraged workers leaving the labor force and no longer being counted as unemployed, but that wasn’t the case in August. Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, or, as the Labor Department defines it, “the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force,” decreased by 295,000 over the month.
Before the jobs report today, the market seemed tied up in a dull, pre-holiday type of trading over the last few sessions. Outside of the data, we don’t really have anything that you can hang your hat on and say this is where we’re going, or that this ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Small Cap', 'Global', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']"

While the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index was nearly double forecast.  However, the news failed to move markets.  
It’s hard to get Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to move 1% but its announcement that it’s hiking its quarterly dividend 11% and starting a $60 billion stock buyback program has the stock on the move. The news helped sustain Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (/YM) which appear to be battling downward pressure. Stock index futures are mixed Wednesday morning with the NASDAQ 100 (NQ) and S&P 500 (/ES) on the positive side. 
Meanwhile, the Business Wire reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) announced plans to buy GreenSky (NASDAQ: GSKY) for $2.24 billion. GSKY is the largest fintech platform for home improvement loan origination. The company allows consumers to “pay as you go” using flexible loan products. 
A few Covid stocks are making waves this morning. Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) traded more than 2% higher in pre-market trading on news that the U.S. government purchased an additional 1.4 million doses of its monoclonal antibody treatment for Covid-19. CureVac’s (NASDAQ: CVAC) vaccine has disappointed in clinical trials leading to the company canceling deals with two manufacturers.
Some gaming stocks are trading lower again because China and Macau want to tighten control over the casino industry. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) fell 10.9% on Tuesday and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) was down 9.6% and both stocks were down 5% in premarket trading. It’s hard to predict regulatory changes so be careful if you’re trying to pick a bottom. 
Other stocks to watch include Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS) which climbed 7.8% in premarket trading as the Wall Street Journal reported that hedge fund Elliott Management had more than $1 billion in the stock. And, Squarespace (NYSE: SQSP) because it’s up 4.9% before the open.
Inflating The Numbers
Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in lower than expected with a seasonally adjusted 0.3% rise in August. July’s CPI rate was 0.5% and June’s was 0.9%. So, August was certainly an improvement. However, inflation has grown 5.3% over the last year, which is being felt by many consumers. 
Core inflation, which excludes more volatile consumer products like food and energy, was up only 0.1% for August, but 4.3% year over year. Slowing price rises is arguably a good sign that the current inflation may only be transitory.

Bonds are trading higher this morning as yields are falling slightly. Lower yields could pull financial stocks lower on the day. However, stock traders appear to be hesitant to commit one way or another as stock futures are relatively flat in front of a new earnings season that is expected to kick off on Wednesday.
One earnings announcement that is out on Tuesday morning is Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST). The seller of nuts and bolts, tools, and supplies reported a 10% increase in sales but is also seeing cost increases. Fastenal did beat estimates, but its talk on rising costs has the stock trading slightly lower in the premarket.
A few more stocks that are moving in premarket trading include GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) which was trading 2.85% higher after Barron’s reported that the company may have a suitor for its consumer goods division. MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) was more than 2% higher after it was upgraded by Credit Suisse analysts with a price forecast at nearly twice its current price. And, Merck (NYSE: MRK) was up about 1% as yesterday’s momentum on the news that it requested an emergency authorization its new COVID-19 pill appears to be spilling over.
Despite trader hesitancy, some investors appear to be looking for value. Chinese stocks have benefited from the value shoppers. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is up 24%, Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY) is up more than 9%, and JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ: JD) is up about 14% from their October lows.
The job openings or JOLTS report will be released after the opening. Analysts are expecting another increase in job openings. However, job openings haven’t been the problem. It’s finding people to fill the positions that have been a problem.  
Stocks started the week on a relatively flat note with the bond market closed and many investors appeared to be a little guarded ahead of a full calendar this Wednesday. The calendar lists important announcements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), FOMC Meeting Minutes, and the start of earnings season. However, investors were still moving a few stocks around on Monday.
One of these stocks was the iron ore company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF), which rallied nearly 4% on the news that it will be getting into the scrap metal business with the acquisition of Ferrous Processing and Trading. The Materials sector was the strongest on Monday, which saw some of its stocks boosted by higher iron ore prices.

(Monday Market Close) The S&P 500 (SPX) broke the 4,300 support level that had been in place since July 2021 and tested it a few times after WTI crude oil futures spiked over the weekend—trading as high as $130 per barrel—as an increasing number of companies are choosing not to buy Russian oil. However, oil prices retreated to $120.10, which was still 3.8% higher than the closing price on Friday.
Rising oil prices helped the energy sector to be one of two sectors in the green on Monday. Investors appeared to favor the defensive nature of utilities overall because the Utilities Select Sector Index rose 1.31%. Treasuries also benefited from investors searching for safe havens because the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) fell 1.57%. A third safe haven appeared to be gold. Gold futures rallied 1.81%, moving back above $2,000 and returning to August 2020 highs.
Fear and uncertainty continue to rise, causing the Cboe Market Volatility Index (VIX) to rise more than 11%. Fear is high enough that initial public offerings (IPOs) are disappearing. January had a record number of cancellations at 22. Currently, there are no IPOs listed on the Nasdaq IPO Calendar for any American exchange in March or going forward.
Commodity Conundrum
Oil was not the only petroleum product to spike. RBOB gasoline futures rallied more than 10% over the weekend but gave back most of its gains and closed just 1.17% higher on the day. Heating oil futures closed 4.82% higher despite reaching nearly 13% higher Sunday evening.
The reasons for the spikes are that many private companies are refusing to buy Russian oil and the United States and European allies are considering bans on Russian commodities, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Previously, these groups have avoided bans on Russian commodities because of how these embargos could hurt consumers already struggling under the weight of pandemic-related inflation.
Embargos on oil could be quite expensive, and it’s causing some analysts to change their projections. Analysts from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) said if Russia’s 5 ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Economics', 'Markets']"

While some jump in blindly, others diligently do their research — and of course, there are those who land somewhere between those boundaries.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and Bridgewater Associates founder and co-Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio bought their first stocks before they were teenagers — and long before online trading platforms were around to make it easier to buy and sell stock or cryptocurrency.
Dalio Tees Off: Dalio bought his first shares when he was 12 years old in the late 1950s. He earned his money as a caddy at The Links Golf Club, saving enough to buy $300 worth of shares in Northeast Airlines, a Boston-based air carrier.
Why did he buy it? According to a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything,"" he had heard golfers talk about it, then his father, a jazz musician, introduced him to a broker who could help Dalio buy the stock.
""I bought it for the stupid reason that it was the only company I'd heard of that was selling for less than $5 a share, so I thought that if it went up, I would make more money,"" said Dalio. ""I got lucky because it was about to go bankrupt and then was acquired by another company, and then I was hooked on playing the market.""
(Howard Hughes acquired control of Northeast in 1962 which sent the stock price up; the airline merged with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) in 1972.)

But Biden has, in effect, helped launch an economic World War III, imposing unprecedented sanctions on a large and economically important country. Russia isn't an Iran or Libya.

Zoltan Strikes Again
Premium subscribers will have another note from Credit Suisse's boy wonder Zoltan Pozsar to savor soon, but Izabella Kaminska, the former editor of the FT's Alphaville, offered a few excerpts and comments before taking her kid to school this morning in Europe. I've included her post in full below, followed by a look at our system's top names as of Thursday's close, which happen to include wheat, oil, and other commodity exposure. 
Authored by Izabella Kaminska of The Blind Spot
""You can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat”
There’s a new Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse report out… and he starts off by saying:
…you can print money, but not oil to heat or wheat to eat.

I’m so glad because this rather obvious point seems to be completely missed by economists and analysts for unknown reasons.
Nor do they seem to get that just because the commodity market doesn’t match the scale of the bond or equity market that doesn’t mean it is not significantly more important for the world economy than anything else.
The way I explain it is that commodities are like the oxygen the body needs to stay alive. The lifeblood is all the other financial stuff.
You can give up a lot of blood and still keep living. But it doesn’t take a very large oxygen deficit to kill you.
Back to Zoltan (before Zerohedge and everyone else is over the report). Or should I say Z̶oltan and Z̶erohedge. (Though I’ve just noticed that striking through the Z makes it look like the Azov battalion symbol so that’s also no good. We are going to have to go with Soltan and Serohedge).
The key point is that Soltan is sticking to his guns about this being a paradigm shifting moment for finance.
And regarding that point that other economists don’t seem to understand (my emphasis):
Central banks are good at curbing demand, not at conjuring supply. Energy and commodities are needed for virtually everything, Russia exports everything, and unlike 1973, it’s not just the price of oil, but the price of everything that is surging. After laying dormant for decades, the fourth price of money is back with a vengeance – the par, basis, and FX-related prices of money are dormant at the moment, but the price level is about to become very volatile and the market is trying to price the price of future money (OIS), that is, the number of interest rate hikes and the FOMC adjusting the level of terminal rates (r*) in response to the new price level regime brought about by war and sanctions

When it comes to commodities Soltan has definitely done his homework. A really great point relates to the important role of shipping in the maintenance of global price equilibrium. If commodities are the oxygen, ships ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Commodities', 'Global', 'Economics', 'Markets']"
