Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Amid the many bouts of short-term mania, there are a handful of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have more than doubled this year. 
Investors with a long-term investing horizon may want to focus on longer-term performance, so here are eight stocks in the S&P 500 that are up by more than 100% in 2021:
Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) is up 172.87% year-to-date. The stock was up 2.21% at $283.28 at market close Wednesday. Its 52-week range is $102.66 to $497.49.

Moderna is a commercial-stage biotech company. Its mRNA technology was rapidly validated with its COVID-19 vaccine, which was authorized in the U.S. in December 2020.

It should come to no shock in how high oil prices have gone this year, and just how important just one barrel of oil is to every industry. Initially, the COVID pandemic depressed energy prices in 2020 sending oil prices below zero before prices snapped back throughout 2020 and 2021 faster as supply did not keep up with demand. In October 2021 even when Omicron was thought to have a dampening effect, the demand for oil was already very high which started to cause a strain for consumers. The Biden administration in November released fifty million barrels of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves, but that did not make any meaningful impact. Moreover, the supply chain bottlenecks certainly did not help as oil is used in over six thousand products that are produced daily. Further, the Russia-Ukraine tensions caused the near time spike in oil reaching ~$130brl before retreating.
